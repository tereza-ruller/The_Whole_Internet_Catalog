History of Internet: 1950: development of electronic computers, 1960: A fundamental pioneer in the call for a global network, J. C. R. Licklider, articulated the ideas in his paper, Man-Computer Symbiosis.: "A network of such [computers], connected to one another by wide-band communication lines [which provided] the functions of present-day libraries together with anticipated advances in information storage and retrieval and [other] symbiotic functions." late 60s: a message was sent over the ARPANet from computer science Professor Leonard Kleinrock's laboratory at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), The ARPANET in particular led to the development of protocols for internetworking, in which multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks. 1981: access to the Arpanet was expanded, the National Science Foundation (NSF) developed the Computer Science Network (CSNET), 1982: the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP), 1986: NSFNET provided access to supercomputer sites in the United States from research and education organizations, mid 80s: NASA developed the TCP/IP based NASA Science Network (NSN), connecting space scientists to data and information stored anywhere in the world. late 80s: Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) began to emerge. 1990: The ARPANET was decommissioned, 1995: Commercialization of Internet, when NSFNET was decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic. mid-1990s: Since then the Internet has had a revolutionary impact on culture and commerce, including the rise of near-instant communication by electronic mail, instant messaging, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) "phone calls", two-way interactive video calls, and the World Wide Web with its discussion forums, blogs, social networking, and online shopping sites. 2005: the World Summit on the Information Society, called for an Internet Governance Forum (IGF) to be convened by United Nations Secretary General. The IGF opened an ongoing, non-binding conversation among stakeholders representing governments, the private sector, civil society, and the technical and academic communities about the future of Internet governance. 2010: The first live Internet link into low earth orbit was established when astronaut T. J. Creamer posted the first unassisted update to his Twitter account from the International Space Station, marking the extension of the Internet into space. (Astronauts at the ISS had used email and Twitter before, but these messages had been relayed to the ground through a NASA data link before being posted by a human proxy.) Communication with spacecraft beyond earth orbit has traditionally been over point-to-point links through the Deep Space Network.
