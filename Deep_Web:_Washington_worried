Washington Worried - notes: http://swampland.time.com/2013/10/31/the-deep-web-has-washington-worried/ , Silk Road, the world’s most successful online drug bazaar. Ross Ulbricht, pseudonym: the Dread Pirate Roberts. Created a business model for anyone wanting to sell illicit items online using free encryption software called Tor and the virtually anonymous crypto-currency Bitcoin. Examine the greater implications of the Deep Web, the massive and growing anonymous area of the Internet. It has created a regulatory headache in figuring how to deal with whole new currencies, tax havens and virtual online. While Tor is used by everyone from law enforcement to Syrian dissidents to protect valuable information, it is a double-edged sword. Many experts warn that groups ranging from the Russian mafia to international drug cartels are looking closely at the lessons learned from the Silk Road. It took the FBI more than two years of investigative work to find Ulbricht. They don’t have the resources to compete with Silicon Valley in hiring, or the tools—a long-hoped for modernization of the law governing online wiretapping is on ice in Congress thanks to Edward Snowden.
