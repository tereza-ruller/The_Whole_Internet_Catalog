Les Horribles Cernettes
Les Horribles Cernettes (French pronunciation: ​[lezɔʁiblə sɛːʁˈnɛt], "The Horrible CERN Girls") is an all-female parody pop group, self-labelled "the one and only High Energy Rock Band", founded by employees of CERN which performs at CERN and other HEP related events. Their musical style is often described as doo-wop. The initials of their name, LHC, are the same as those of the Large Hadron Collider which was later built at CERN.[1][2][3]
