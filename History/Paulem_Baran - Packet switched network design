Paul Baran: Packet switched network design: in 1959 at the time of Cold War, Baran took on the task of designing a "survivable" communications system that could maintain communication between end points in the face of damage from nuclear weapons. Barab showed that a distributed relay node architecture could be survivable. Using the mini-computer technology of the day, Baran and his team developed a simulation suite to test basic connectivity of an array of nodes with varying degrees of linking. That is, a network of n-ary degree of connectivity would have n links per node. The result of this was one of the first store-and-forward data layer switching protocols, a link-state/distance vector routing protocol, and an unproved connection-oriented transport protocol. Explicit detail of these designs can be found in the complete series of reports "On Distributed Communications", published by RAND in 1964. This Distributed Network that Baran introduced was intended to route around damage. It provided connection to others through many points, not one centralized connection. In conjuncture with the distributed network, Baran also developed a second, revolutionary concept; message blocking. The idea being that by of dividing information into "message blocks" before sending them out across the network, data could travel faster and communications lines used more efficiently. Each block would be sent separately, traveling through different paths and finally rejoined into a whole when they were received at their destination.
