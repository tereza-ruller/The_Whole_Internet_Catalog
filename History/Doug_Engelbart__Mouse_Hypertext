Doug Engelbart: (January 30, 1925 – July 2, 2013) was an American engineer and inventor, and an early computer and Internet pioneer. He is best known for his work on the challenges of human–computer interaction, particularly while at his Augmentation Research Center Lab (70s), resulting in the invention of the computer mouse, and the development of hypertext, networked computers, and precursors to graphical user interfaces, bitmapped screens. These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968. During an interview, he said "SRI patented the mouse, but they really had no idea of its value. Some years later it was learned that they had licensed it to Apple Computer for something like $40,000." Engelbart showcased the chorded keyboard and many more of his and ARC's inventions in 1968 at the so-called Mother of All Demos.
