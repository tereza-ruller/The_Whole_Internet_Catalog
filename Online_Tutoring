Online tutoring: the process of tutoring in an online, virtual environment or networked environment in which teachers and learners are separated by time and space. Online tutoring, as a reflection of the diversity of the wider Internet, is practiced using many different approaches and is addressed to distinct sets of users. The distinctions are in online content and interface, as well as in tutoring and tutor-training methodologies. Definitions associated with online tutoring vary widely, reflecting the ongoing evolution of the technology, the refinement and variation in online learning methodology, and the interactions of the organizations that deliver online tutoring services with the institutions, individuals, and learners that employ the services. This form of Internet service is a classical micropublishing situation. Online environments applied in education usually involve the use of learning management systems or Virtual Learning Environments such as Moodle, Sakai, WebCT, Blackboard. Online tutoring may be offered either directly through the virtual learning environment of a tutoring service or via a link in a learning management system. In the first case, the learner or his or her parents may be required to pay for tutoring time before the delivery of service, whereas many educational institutions and major textbook publishers sponsor a certain amount of tutoring without a direct charge to the learner. Forms: I. many-to-one tutoring: a group of learners simultaneously logged in and receiving instruction from a single tutor. This is often known as e-moderation. II. one-on-one tutoring: individual learners purchase tutoring time with a private vendor of online tutoring service. Such time may also be made available through the purchase of a book, access to a library, a textbook publisher, or enrollment in a particular school or school system. III. Asynchronous online tutoring:t he learner submits a question and the tutor responds at a later time. This is appropriate to detailed review of writing, for instance. The learner and the tutor need not be online at the same time. IV. Synchronous online tutoring: involves a shared interface, such that both the tutor and the learner (or a group of learners) are online at the same time. V. Automated tutors: The Problem Generator (PG) creates practice questions. PG covers six subjects: arithmetic, number theory, algebra, calculus, linear algebra and statistics. The difficulty of the questions can be adjusted for different ages/abilities.
