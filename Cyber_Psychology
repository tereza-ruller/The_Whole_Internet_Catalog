Parents’ Online Behavior
- nalyze the research that has been conducted on parents’ use of the Internet and determine what we know about how parents use the Internet in everyday life
Technology and the Internet in particular have drastically changed the way we receive information, interact with others, entertain ourselves, make plans, and organize our lives (Shirkey, 2008). Although technology use is increasing among all populations (Martin & Robinson, 2007; National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), 2011), parents are more connected to and enthusiastic about technology than non-parents. In 2002, 70% of parents in the U.S. used the Internet compared to 53% of non-parents; 79% of parents in the U.S. used computers compared to 63% of non-parents (Allen & Rainie, 2002). More recently, broadband access among U.S. households with children was between 63% and 84% compared to 55% of households without children (NTIA, 2011). Similarly, Internet access among households with children has been found to outpace access among households without children in Canada and England (Statistics Canada, 2010; UK Statistics Authority, 2010). Although it is clear that parents are active Internet users, lack of a coherent body of research has resulted in only scattered knowledge about parents’ actual online behavior.

The effects of text, audio, video, and in-person communication on bonding between friends
Considerable research on computer-mediated communication has examined online communication between strangers, but little is known about the emotional experience of connectedness between friends in digital environments. However, adolescents and emerging adults use digital communication primarily to communicate with existing friends rather than to make new connections. We compared feelings of emotional connectedness as they occurred in person and through digital communication among pairs of close friends in emerging adulthood. Fifty-eight young women, recruited in pairs of close friends, engaged in four conversations each: in-person, video chat, audio chat, and instant messaging (IM). Bonding in each condition was measured through both self-report and affiliation cues (i.e., nonverbal behaviors associated with the emotional experience of bonding). Participants reported feeling connected in all conditions. However, bonding, as measured by both self-report and affiliation cues, differed significantly across conditions, with the greatest bonding during in-person interaction, followed by video chat, audio chat, and IM in that order. Compared with other participants, those who used video chat more frequently reported greater bonding with friends through video chat in our study. Compared with other participants, those who spoke on the phone more frequently with their participating friend reported greater bonding during audio chat. Use of textual affiliation cues like emoticons, typed laughter, and excessive letter capitalization during IM related to increased bonding experience during IM. Nonetheless, a significantly lower level of bonding was experienced in IM compared with in-person communication. Because adolescent and emerging adults’ digital communication is primarily text-based, this finding has significant real-world implications.
Emerging adults are among the most avid users of digital communication technologies, including texting, instant messaging (IM), and video chat (Duggan & Brenner, 2013; Lenhart et al., 2011). Furthermore, today’s 18-29 year olds are often described as “digital natives” because they have grown up using these technologies, utilizing text-based tools to develop existing friendships during adolescence, a sensitive period for socioemotional development (Baird, 2010; Prensky, 2001; Steinberg, 2005). While research has established that digital communication can enhance existing friendships over the long-term (e.g., Valkenburg & Peter, 2007, 2009), a continuing concern among some is that youth are less “connected” than they were in the past or that increasing digital communication contributes to stunted socioemotional or empathic growth (Small & Vorgan, 2008; Turkle, 2012). This question is provocative, but difficult to test empirically. One way to address potential differences in digital and in-person communication is to compare them directly. In developmental psychology, the existing literature on social media use, while increasingly sophisticated, has nonetheless relied primarily on survey-based approaches. In the field of communication and media studies, on the other hand, a rich literature spanning from the middle of the 20th century to the present has experimentally compared in-person and computer-mediated communication (CMC). However, it has been primarily concerned with the establishment of new relationships, rather than communication between existing friends. Our study fills this gap. Drawing on the experimental traditions of CMC research, the present study aimed to directly compare digital and in-person communication between pairs of close, emerging-adult friends to ascertain potential differences in ability to foster bonding. Bonding was defined as the momentary emotional experience of feeling connected to and affection for a friend.
However, as digital communication more closely resembles in-person interaction, youth more effectively achieve emotional closeness. Video chat, which affords the ability to exchange both verbal and visual cues, more closely resembled in-person communication in terms of bonding than it did IM. The subjective experience of bonding was not significantly less, when communication was in person compared with video chat. Video chat is growing in popularity (Lenhart, 2012) and is now available on mobile tools like smartphones and tablets. It is only one of several new digital technologies that rely on visual or audiovisual communication—the popular photo-texting application, Snapchat, is another example. As the technology continues to improve and becomes faster and clearer, we may see a tendency to prefer visual and audiovisual communication to textual communication in digital environments, allowing both adolescents and adults to more effectively connect. A decade down the line, experimental studies inspired by adolescents’ typical digital media use may be asking very different questions.

All the (cyber) world’s a stage: Framing cyberbullying as a performance
Bullying is a multifaceted phenomenon which has been an issue for research for several decades. This study focussed on understanding female experiences of bullying and by extension cyberbullying. Having identified a gap in the literature regarding girls’ experiences and participation in bullying, the aim of this study was to explore bullying from a female perspective. Research has found that girls’ attempts to harm others tend to focus on damaging another child's friendships or feelings of inclusion within their peer groups (Crick & Grotpeter, 1995; Underwood, 2004). Furthermore, research suggests that girls prefer to use indirect or ‘hidden’ ways to bully others such as spreading rumours, non verbal aggression, or social exclusion (Besag, 2006; Brown, 2003; Pipher, 1994; Simmons, 2002), so it is particularly interesting to consider what role online forms of communication play in relation to girls’ friendships and interactions and how they may be used to bully others.
Bullying using technology is the latest manifestation of the phenomenon to attract research attention. This type of bullying is mainly referred to in the literature as ‘cyberbullying’ (Dooley, Pyzalski, & Cross, 2009; Hinduja & Patchin, 2009; Shariff, 2008; Smith, Mahdavi, Carvalho, Fisher, Russell, & Tippett, 2008; Vandebosch & Van Cleemput, 2009; Willard, 2007), although it may also be referred to as ‘electronic bullying’ or ‘online social cruelty’ (Kowalski, Limber, & Agatston, 2008) or internet harassment (Ybarra & Mitchell, 2004). There is a tendency for definitions of cyberbullying to comprise of two elements: (i) some or the whole definition of traditional bullying and; (ii) a list of electronic devices through which cyberbullying can occur (Dooley et al., 2009; Vandebosch & Van Cleemput, 2009). Willard defines cyberbullying as “sending or posting harmful material or engaging in other forms of social aggression using the Internet or other digital technologies” (Willard, 2007, p.265). This particular definition was useful for this study due to the emphasis of social aggression which is particularly relevant in discussions with young girls around female bullying. Some of the social media associated with cyberbullying may be used to conduct traditional bullying behaviour such as name calling, spreading rumours and harassment. Media commonly used in cyberbullying is often focussed around text messaging, pictures or photos or video clips, phone calls, email, chat rooms, instant messaging and websites (Smith et al., 2008).
In terms of cyberspace, the audience may be larger than that of conventional bullying and may be potentially infinite. The evidence of how girls report using cyberspace for communication and interaction with each other in this study suggests that the audience contains a high peer presence. In contrast, the literature would seem to indicate that this space also has a low adult presence (Livingstone, 2008). These characteristics of cyberspace may result in greater fear and humiliation of the target compared to an offline performance of bullying. These factors illustrate to some extent how cyberbullying may result in intensifying the performance of bullying as the target may experience bullying in relatively safe physical spaces at any time, the audience may be made up of large numbers of their own peer group and the bully has the potential of remaining anonymous. Results would seem to suggest that while it may be easier to use cyberbullying as a way to bully others, it may cause greater distress for the target than more conventional forms of bullying.

A method for collecting and interpreting interpersonal behavioral data in Second Life: A sample study on Asians’, Blacks’, and Whites’ social distances
Research on inter-group behavior is increasingly being conducted using virtual world technology (e.g., Eastwick & Gardner, 2009; Feldon & Kafai, 2008). Although this research approach is still in its early development, its potential for facilitating social psychological research has already been recognized (Blascovich et al., 2002; Lazer et al., 2009). For example, social psychologists doing experimental research have long recognized the tension between the need for developing tightly controlled environments (e.g., a laboratory) while avoiding the creation of mundane social environments that lack the nuances of a real life environment (Blascovich et al., 2002). Virtual worlds offer a setting in which a realistic social environment can be approximated, while maintaining a tightly controlled environment.
One challenge facing virtual world researchers is the possibility of an “online disinhibition effect” in which participants tend to display more extroverted, assertive, and even hostile behavior online than in real life (Postmes, Spears, & Lea, 2002; Suler, 2004). One possible interpretation is that these behaviors are actually a better reflection of one’s “true self” when compared to self-report methods that may be subject to social desirability effects. For instance, a participant who holds relatively hostile views about inter-racial interactions may be more willing to express this hostility in a virtual world where he or she is anonymous. In any case, it remains undetermined the extent to which behavior in an online environment is more or less reflective of real behavior when compared to self-report methods. Ultimately, we propose that the strongest approach to approximating behavior is the triangulation of multiple methods. At present, the behavioral sciences have a surplus of self-report methods and greater inclusion of virtual method research provides a widely useful alternative.

The quality of online, offline, and mixed-mode friendships among users of a social networking site
The first aim of this study was to compare the quality of online, offline, and mixed-mode friendships (i.e., friendships that originate online and extend to offline settings) among users of a social networking site. The second aim was to investigate the relative contribution of proximity, perceived similarity, and social attraction to the quality of each of the three types of friendships. We surveyed 2,188 members of a Dutch social networking site. Results showed that the quality of all three types of friendships increased over time. The differences in quality between online and offline friendships remained significant over time, but those between mixed-mode and offline friendships disappeared. Proximity did not affect the quality of any of the three types of friendships. Perceived similarity was the most important predictor of online friendships, whereas social attraction was the most important predictor of mixed-mode and offline friendships. Our results are discussed in the light of both interpersonal and computer-mediated communication theories.
Social capital is important in society. It has been linked to a variety of positive social outcomes, such as better public health, lower crime rates, and more efficient financial markets (Adler & Kwon, 2002). Social capital can be defined as “the sum of resources, actual or virtual, that accrue to an individual or a group by virtue of possessing a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance an recognition” (Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992, p.14). Putnam (2000) distinguishes between two types of social capital: bridging and bonding.
Bridging social capital is the benefit from weak ties, found between individuals with loose connections who may provide useful information, but typically not emotional support (Putnam, 2000; Grannovetter, 1983). Bonding social capital is the benefit from strong ties, found between individuals in emotionally close and high quality relationships, such as family and close friends (Putnam, 2000). Although there is ample research about the effect of the Internet on bridging social capital (Donath & boyd, 2004; Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2007; Steinfield, Ellison, & Lampe, 2008), little empirical work has examined the effects of the Internet on bonding social capital (Williams, 2006).
