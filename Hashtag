Hashtags
A hashtag is a word or an unspaced phrase prefixed with the symbol #. It is a form of metadata tag. Short messages on microblogging and social networking services such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram may be tagged by putting "#" before important words (no spaces),[3] either as they appear in a sentence, (e.g., "New artists announced for #SXSW 2012 Music Festival!")or appended to it.
Hashtags provide a means of grouping such messages, since one can search for the hashtag and get the set of messages that contain it. A hashtag is only connected to a specific medium and can therefore not be linked and connected to pictures or messages from different platforms.
Hashtags first appeared and were used within IRC networks to label groups and topics. They are also used to mark individual messages as relevant to a particular group, and to mark individual messages as belonging to a particular topic or "channel".
