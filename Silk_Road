Silk Road: is an online black market. It is operated as a Tor hidden service, such that online users are able to browse it anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring. The website launched in February 2011; development had begun six months prior. Silk Road is an underground website,sometimes called the "Amazon.com of illegal drugs"or the "eBay for drugs". Initially, buyers could register for free, but there were a limited number of new seller accounts available. On October 2, 2013, the FBI shut down Silk Road. They arrested Ross William Ulbricht on charges of alleged murder for hire and narcotics trafficking violation and identified him as the founder and chief operator "Dread Pirate Roberts". On November 6, 2013 Forbes and Vice reported that Silk Road 2.0 was online and being run by former administrators of Silk Road and that a different user was now using the name Dread Pirate Roberts. Products: As of March 2013, the site had 10,000 products for sale by vendors, 70% were drugs that are considered contraband in most jurisdictions. 340 varieties of drugs were being sold, including heroin, LSD, and cannabis. The site's terms of service prohibit the sale of "anything who's purpose is to harm or defraud." This includes child pornography, stolen credit cards, assassinations, and weapons of mass destruction. There were also legal goods and services for sale, such as apparel, art, books, cigarettes, erotica, jewelry, and writing services. A sister site, called "The Armory", sold weapons (primarily guns) during 2012 but was shut down due to a lack of demand. Sales: Based on data from 3 February 2012 to 24 July 2012, an estimated $15 million in transactions were made annually on Silk Road. Buyers and sellers conducted all transactions with bitcoins (BTC), a cryptocurrency that provides a certain degree of anonymity. "From February 6, 2011 to July 23, 2013 there were approximately 1,229,465 transactions completed on the site." The value of the transactions over this period are equivalent to "roughly $1.2 billion in revenue and $79.8 million in commissions" and involved 146,946 buyers and 3,877 vendors.
