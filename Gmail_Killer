Facebook's Gmail Killer Project: a web-based email client that we hear is unofficially referred to internally as its “Gmail killer”. Now we’ve heard from sources that this is indeed what’s coming on Monday during Facebook’s special event, alongside personal @facebook.com email addresses for users. This isn’t a big surprise — the event invites Facebook sent out hinted strongly that the news would have something to do with its Inbox, sparking plenty of speculation that the event could be related to Titan. Our understanding is that this is more than just a UI refresh for Facebook’s existing messaging service with POP access tacked on. Rather, Facebook is building a full-fledged webmail client, and while it may only be in early stages come its launch Monday, there’s a huge amount of potential here. 'Email is dead' claims Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg as he launches 'Google Gmail killer' messaging service. Facebook’s 500million users will mean it poses a huge threat to all its competitors. 'Facebook.com': Potentially 500million users for its new messaging service. Hotmail: 362million users. Yahoo!: 273million users. Gmail: 193million users.
