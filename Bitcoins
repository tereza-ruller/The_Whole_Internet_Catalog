Bitcoins: Bitcoin is an open source peer-to-peer electronic money and payment network introduced in 2009 by pseudonymous developer "Satoshi Nakamoto". Bitcoin has been called a cryptocurrency because it uses cryptography to secure transactions. Digitally signed payment messages are broadcast to and verified by a decentralized network of computers all over the world. Specialized computers use a proof-of-work system to prevent people from copying and spending the same Bitcoin multiple times, a problem for digital currencies known as double-spending. The operators of these computers, known as "miners", are rewarded with transaction fees and newly minted Bitcoins. Bitcoins are stored by associating them with addresses called "wallets". Wallets can be stored on web services, on local hardware like PCs and mobile devices, or on paper print-outs. Thefts of Bitcoins from web services and online wallets have been covered in the media, prompting assertions that the safest way to store Bitcoins is in a paper wallet generated on an uncompromised computer by yourself. In 2012, The Economist reasoned that Bitcoin has been popular because of "its role in dodgy online markets", and in 2013 the FBI shut down one such service, Silk Road, which specialized in illegal drugs (whereupon the FBI took control of approximately 1.5% of all bitcoins in circulation). However, Bitcoins are increasingly used as payment for legitimate products and services, and merchants have an incentive to accept the currency because transaction fees are lower than the 2 to 3% typically imposed by credit card processors. Notable vendors include OkCupid, Reddit, WordPress, and Chinese Internet giant Baidu. Users who devote computing power to maintaining the blockchain are called "miners" because they are awarded in bitcoin when they are first to solve such puzzlesâ€”mining is how new Bitcoins are generated. The mathematical calculations performed by miners' computers serve to verify that each transaction is valid and add the information to the blockchain. As more Bitcoins come into circulation, the puzzles involved in mining them become increasingly difficult. Anonymity: Bitcoin uses cryptography for digital signatures but not for encryption. Bitcoin is anonymous in that it's possible though difficult to associate Bitcoin transactions with real-life identities. In addition, Bitcoin intermediaries such as exchanges are required by law in many jurisdictions to collect personal customer data. Bitcoin's association with criminal activities has historically hindered the currency from attaining widespread, mainstream use and has attracted the attention of financial regulators, legislative bodies, and law enforcement.
