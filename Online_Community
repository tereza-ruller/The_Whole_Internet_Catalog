Online Community: is a virtual community that exists online and whose members enable its existence through taking part in membership ritual. An online community can take the form of an information system where anyone can post content, such as a Bulletin board system or one where only a restricted number of people can initiate posts, such as Weblogs. Online communities have also become a supplemental form of communication between people who know each other primarily in real life. Many means are used in social software separately or in combination, including text-based chat rooms and forums that use voice, video text or avatars. Significant socio-technical change may have resulted from the proliferation of such Internet-based social networking services. The idea of a community is not a new concept. What is new, however, is transferring it over into the online world. They are: I. Content: articles, information, and news about a topic of interest to a group of people. II. Forums or newsgroups and email: so that your community members can communicate in delayed fashion. III. Chat and instant messaging: so that the community members can communicate more immediately. Examples of successful Internet Communities are: I. Buddy Pic: where you upload a picture of yourself and are judged based on it. II. Something Awful: a comedy forum where users post comedy ideas. It has been responsible for many Internet fads over the years. III. Gaia Online: is a large online community with 23 million registered accounts. It is mostly a community that discusses anime and video games. Online communities were developed to encourage individuals to come together to teach and learn from one another. They open the door for collaborative learning and focus more on how individuals learn from each rather than how they learn from an instructor. Types: I. Communities of transaction emphasize the importance of buying and selling products in a social online manner where people must interact in order to complete the transaction. II. Communities of interest involve the online interaction of people with specific knowledge on a certain topic. III. Communities of fantasy encourage people to participate in online alternative forms of reality, such as games where they are represented by avatars. IV. Communities of relationship often reveal or at least partially protect someone's identity while allowing them to communicate with others, such as in online dating services.
