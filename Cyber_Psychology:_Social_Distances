A method for collecting and interpreting interpersonal behavioral data in Second Life: A sample study on Asians’, Blacks’, and Whites’ social distances: Research on inter-group behavior is increasingly being conducted using virtual world technology. Although this research approach is still in its early development, its potential for facilitating social psychological research has already been recognized. For example, social psychologists doing experimental research have long recognized the tension between the need for developing tightly controlled environments (e.g., a laboratory) while avoiding the creation of mundane social environments that lack the nuances of a real life environment. Virtual worlds offer a setting in which a realistic social environment can be approximated, while maintaining a tightly controlled environment. One challenge facing virtual world researchers is the possibility of an “online disinhibition effect” in which participants tend to display more extroverted, assertive, and even hostile behavior online than in real life. One possible interpretation is that these behaviors are actually a better reflection of one’s “true self” when compared to self-report methods that may be subject to social desirability effects. For instance, a participant who holds relatively hostile views about inter-racial interactions may be more willing to express this hostility in a virtual world where he or she is anonymous. In any case, it remains undetermined the extent to which behavior in an online environment is more or less reflective of real behavior when compared to self-report methods. Ultimately, we propose that the strongest approach to approximating behavior is the triangulation of multiple methods. At present, the behavioral sciences have a surplus of self-report methods and greater inclusion of virtual method research provides a widely useful alternative.
