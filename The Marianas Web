The Marianas Web: To gain access to this part of the Deep Web, a special hardware is necessary: some argue that you need an old computer and OS. Beyond the Charter Web exists 80% of the Internet. What the Marianas Web contains is unknown. It is rumored to contain government databases and secret information on several conspiration theories, paranormal events and secret experiments (Hollow Earth, secret societies). This is very unlikely and has yet to be proven by someone who really gained access to this part of the Internet. The things that can be found on the Deep Web conisist of and is not limited too; drug dealers, munitions, hit men, death matches, prostitution, illegal media downloads, child pornography, gore, guides on how to do illegal things, and information on events that governments have covered up.
