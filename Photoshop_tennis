Photoshop tennis
Photoshop tennis is an online game, in which a website or user of an Internet forum will post a starting image — usually a photograph — and ask others to manipulate the image using some kind of graphics editing software, such as Photoshop. While Photoshop is the industry standard image editing program, Adobe discourages use of "Photoshop" to refer to anything other than Adobe's photo editing software, to prevent its trademark from becoming a genericized trademark.

Photoshop tennis originated in graphics-related internet forums in the early-2000s, and shares an earlier history with online image games such as SITO's "PANIC" (started January, 1994). The game was made popular by art director Jim Coudal in 2001 as "Photoshop Tennis". The matches on coudal.com have since been renamed Layer Tennis, as they are no longer restricted to the use of Adobe Photoshop.

Rules: The players pick a starting image, or one is "served" by a player, then another player makes some sort of alteration to the image in any chosen image editor. He or she then sends that altered image to the other player, who then edits that image and sends it back to the first player. This process goes back and forth until a predetermined number of rounds have elapsed. When the final round is over, there may be an independent judge who determines who has played the best shots, and declares that person the winner.
