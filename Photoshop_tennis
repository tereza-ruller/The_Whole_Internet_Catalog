Photoshop tennis
Photoshop tennis is an online game, in which a website or user of an Internet forum will post a starting image — usually a photograph — and ask others to manipulate the image using some kind of graphics editing software, such as Photoshop. While Photoshop is the industry standard image editing program, Adobe discourages use of "Photoshop" to refer to anything other than Adobe's photo editing software, to prevent its trademark from becoming a genericized trademark.
