Nodocentrism

= "rules governing interaction between nodes, and between nodes and what is outside of the network.
Basically, nearness in a network is constituted on the basis of nodes recognizing other nodes. Nodocentrism constructs a social reality in which nodes can only 'see' other nodes, and only nodes deserve to be accounted for." 

characteristic of Networked Proximity (= nearness*), defined by Ulises Mejias: "One way to define social media or participatory media is by using this concept of social relevancy. We could say that participatory media open up new possibilities for elements in a social system to be relevant to each other, to belong to the same social whole, regardless of how great or how small the physical distance between them." 
*'Nearness' 
- does not simply describes physical distance, but our affective relationship to something. 
- Something that is not physically present can be part of our social environment. 
- If something generates information and we are capable of receiving that information, it can become socially relevant.
- in a network, relevance is determined by informational availability, not physical proximity
- social networks are assemblages of human and non-human actors

“A network is quite incapable of recognizing things that are not nodes. If something is available in the network, it is perceived as part of reality, but if it is not available it might as well not exist.

“Nodocentrism means that while networks are extremely efficient at establishing links between nodes, they embody a bias against knowledge of – and engagement with – anything that is not a node in the same network. The point is not that nodocentrism in social networks impoverishes social life or devalues the near: nodes behave neither anti-socially (they thrive in linking to other nodes) nor anti-locally (they can link to other nodes in their immediate surrounding just as easily as they can link to remote nodes). The point, rather, is that nodocentrism constructs a social reality in which nodes can only see other nodes.”

*node: 
- In communication networks, a node (Latin nodus, ‘knot’) is either a connection point, a redistribution point or a communication endpoint (some terminal equipment). The definition of a node depends on the network and protocol layer referred to. 
- A physical network node is an active electronic device that is attached to a network, and is capable of sending, receiving, or forwarding information over a communications channel. 
- A passive distribution point such as a distribution frame or patch panel is consequently not a node.
