Media Archaeology: Ap-proaches, Applications,and Implications. Editedby Erkki Huhtamo & JussiParikka: www.academia.edu The word “archaeology” has had a singular appeal in the fields of media and cul-tural history, especially but not exclusively in regard to visual media such as photog-raphy and film. As Huhtamo and Parikka accurately note, the roots of mediaarchaeology should be located within two distinct traditions. On one side, media ar-chaeologists often referred this wordingto Michel Foucault’s notion of the archaeologyof knowledge (Foucault, 1972). On the other side, the term “archaeology” has beenfrequently used, at least since the 1960s, in the field of film studies. In this context, au-thors such as C.W. Ceram (1965), Jacques Perriault (1981), and, more recently, LaurentMannoni (1995), proposed the “archaeology of cinema” as a kind of prehistory of themedium, pointing to philosophical toys, techniques of projections, photographic tech-nologies, and illusions of movements that preceded the advent of film.In the past decade, the term has become ubiquitous in media studies. Scholarshave struggled to apply it to the most dissimilar subjects, proposing—to give but afew examples—an archaeology of compositing (Manovich, 2002), an archaeology of television (Müller, 2000), or an archaeology of peep media (Huhtamo, 2006), and em-ploying different methodologies and theoretical frameworks. In this sense, there is not just one “media archaeology,” but several of them. The idea of “deep time” was linked to the discovery that “the Earth’s evolution was not a linear process, but a dynamic cycle of erosion, deposition, consolidation, anduplifting before erosion starts the cycle anew” To Zielinski,the importance of such moments, which he calls “windows” or “cuts,” is usually understated because of the genealogicaland linear approach employed by most historians of media.
