Participatory War 2.0: www.upress.umn.edu , book OFF THE NETWORK: Disrupting the Digital World by Ulises Ali MejiAs: Gilles Deleuze observed, “We write only at the frontiers of our knowledge, at the border which separates our knowledge from our ignorance and transforms the one into the other.” " Networks mater because they are the underlying structure of our lives. And without understanding their logic we cannot change their programmes to harness their fexibility to our hopes, instead of relentlessly adapting ourselves to the instructions received from their unseen codes. Networks are the Matrix. Manuel Castells, “Why NetWorks Matter”. On May 31, 2010, an estimated thirty- three thousand people1 committed suicide in a collective wave of global proportions. In the opinion of the media, however, the aggregated death of those thousands was essentially insignifcant. Thankfully, no blood was spilled that day, since the act of annihilation in question involved permanently deleting one’s Facebook account in what came to be known as Quit Facebook Day — an expression of rage over the company’s privacy policies for some, and of disillusionment with virtual life for others. In the words of an early advocate, “The movement could reach epidemic levels if more users kill off their electronic selves rather than submit to corporate control over their friendships. Facebook, and the other corporate lackeys, will then learn that they can’t exploit our social relationships for proft. From viral growth will come a viral death as more people demand that Facebook dies so our friendships may thrive.” Availing themselves of how-to advice from the movement’s main website (Quitfacebookday.com), as well as tools like the Web 2.0 Suicide Machine (Suicidemachine.org), people removed themselves from the popular social networking site because they agreed with the general sentiment that “Facebook doesn’t respect you, your personal data, or the future of the web.” The mass exodus that was hoped for did not materialize, but at least the movement generated a public relations disturbance that led Facebook to reconsider its policies or at least to try to do a better job of explaining them. Thus the events surrounding Quit Facebook Day shed some light on today’s frequently tense relation between the rights of the user and the interests of the corporations that operate digital social networks.
