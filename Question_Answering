Question Answering (QA) is a computer science discipline within the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP), which is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language. A QA implementation, usually a computer program, may construct its answers by querying a structured database of knowledge or information, usually a knowledge base. More commonly, QA systems can pull answers from an unstructured collection of natural language documents. Some examples of natural language document collections used for QA systems include: I. a local collection of reference texts, II. internal organization documents and web pages, III. compiled newswire reports, IV. a set of Wikipedia pages, V. a subset of World Wide Web pages. QA research attempts to deal with a wide range of question types including: fact, list, definition, How, Why, hypothetical, semantically constrained, and cross-lingual questions. Early QA systems: BASEBALL (answered questions about the US baseball league), LUNAR (answered questions about the geological analysis of rocks returned by the Apollo moon missions) , ELIZA, DOCTOR(first chatterbot programs), SHRDLU (by Terry Winograd in the late 60s). The 1970s and 1980s saw the development of comprehensive theories in computational linguistics, which led to the development of ambitious projects in text comprehension and question answering. One example of such a system was the Unix Consultant (UC), developed by Robert Wilensky in the late 1980s. Architecture: Natural language processing techniques are used to both process the question and index or process the text corpus from which answers are extracted. QA systems typically include a question classifier module that determines the type of question and the type of answer. After the question is analysed, the system typically uses several modules that apply increasingly complex NLP techniques on a gradually reduced amount of text. A multiagent question-answering architecture has been proposed, where each domain is represented by an agent which tries to answer questions taking into account its specific knowledge. The metaâ€“agent controls the cooperation between question answering agents and chooses the most relevant answer(s). Question answering methods: QA is very dependent on a good search corpus. Question answering heavily relies on reasoning. There are a number of question answering systems designed in Prolog, a logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence.
