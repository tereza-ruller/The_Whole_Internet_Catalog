Stratagem: www.spc.org , A stratagem is a plan or scheme to deceive. A confidence trick is an attempt to defraud a person or group after first gaining their confidence, in the classical sense of trust. From Evil Media: I. stratagem one: bypass representation: The basic strategy is not to denounce, nor to advocate but rather to create a problem of a different order to that of representation and then follow through practically what it entails. II. stratagem two: exploit anachronisms: to draw attention to a range and style of practices which are badly understood when explicitly or implicitly measured against the yardstick of autonomous rationality and the ideal of knowledge. III. stratagem three: stimulate malignancy: To talk of evil is also to insist on an ontological dimension of the reality to which the order of communication belongs: the non-sense of something that cannot be exchanged for meaning, which is infinitely tangential to representation (but is not necessarily ‘repressed’). IV. machine the commonplace: For a number of recent commentators, language and communication are now absolutely central components of the economy.  This shift in the place assigned to communication in the economy opens up a new range of issues to consider and casts new light on the changing nature of work in the contemporary economy. From the restricted practical analysis being sketched out here, the general claim, if not the specific details, suggests some unlikely antecedents for contemporary practices in digital media. V. make the accidental the essential, a perception of language and of logic in which faults, glitches and bugs started to be seen simply as accidents, trivial anomalies easily removed by means of the better internal policing of language. Short of being a two-headed monster or a plant of some sort, you could not possibly say one thing and mean two. The norms of reason precluded this: transparency should be the elimination of agonism, not its secret accumulation. VI.: Other strategems: recurse stratagems, the rapture of capture,sophisticating machinery, what is good for natural language is good for formal language,  know your data, liberate determinism, inattention economy, brains beyond language, keep your stratagem secret as long as possible, take care of the symbols, the sense will follow, the creativity of matter,...
