Top Virtual Worlds by www.virtualworldinfo.com: Virtual worlds are growing fast. In 2009, there were 136 million people active in virtual worlds. That number is projected to grow to over 2 billion in 2014. There are many different varieties of virtual worlds, from 2D and 3D worlds to user-generated content or professional content, from browser-based and download worlds to free or paid worlds, and from chat-based to more game-like massively multiplayer worlds. 1) Onverse: While it is a social virtual world, it is more game-like than most virtual worlds. You can run around and collect points for shopping to upgrade from a free apartment, dress your avatar, collect pets, and most of all, play games. The gaming angle is why we both really liked it and also think the future is bright for it. 2) Habbo Hotel: Habbo is one of the oldest worlds out there, and thus has a lot of things to do. 3) There: There is a fun place. Tons of areas, customizations galore, and even some humorous situations to boot. 4) Free Realms: a beautiful world with a lot of activities, customizations, you name it!  The problem we found is that it really doesn't feel like a virtual world, it feels more like an MMORPG. 5) Second Life: is the poster child for the first thing people think of when someone says "virtual world." While it is a wonderful concept and the possibilities are endless, our review board tends to like things more focused towards fun things to do. Second Life is just a little overwhelming for someone who just wants to have a laugh and is more intended as a tool for creation, rather than just being able to hop in and have fun. We have to hand them a top 5 though as if it weren't for SL, most of the others wouldn't have been built. Careful, as many areas are very adult-themed.
