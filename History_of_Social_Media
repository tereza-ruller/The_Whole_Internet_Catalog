The Brief History of Social Media
Where people interact freely, sharing and discussing information about their lives.

Social media are Internet sites where people interact freely, sharing and discussing information about each other and their lives, using a multimedia mix of personal words, pictures, videos and audio. 
At these Web sites, individuals and groups create and exchange content and engage in person-to-person conversations. 
They appear in many forms including blogs and microblogs, forums and message boards, social networks, wikis, virtual worlds, social bookmarking, tagging and news, writing communities, digital storytelling and scrapbooking, and data, content, image and video sharing, podcast portals, and collective intelligence.
